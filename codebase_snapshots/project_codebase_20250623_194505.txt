          <p>The most powerful evidence against materialism comes from "veridical perception" cases. These are instances where patients, while clinically dead or unconscious with no measurable brain activity, report observing objective events (e.g., conversations, surgical instruments) that were outside the reach of their physical senses and are later verified as accurate.</p>
          <p class="mt-3">Even a single confirmed case is sufficient to falsify the claim that consciousness is solely a product of brain activity. Documented cases include:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>The Pam Reynolds Case:</strong> During "Operation Standstill" (a surgery with induced hypothermic cardiac arrest and no brain activity), she accurately described a unique surgical saw she had never seen and overheard conversations from the operating room.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Dentures" Case:</strong> A patient, after reviving from a coma, told a nurse the exact, unusual location of his dentures, which had been removed while he was unconscious.</li>

            <li><strong>The Being of Light:</strong> "God is light; in him there is no darkness at all." (1 John 1:5). This figure is consistently described with attributes of love, knowledge, and authority matching the person of Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>The Life Review:</strong> "...each of us will give an account of ourselves to God." (Romans 14:12). NDEs suggest this is not a legalistic trial but a process of self-evaluation in the presence of perfect love.</li>
            <li><strong>Heaven and Hell:</strong> Positive NDEs describe a paradise of light, love, and beauty, while the rarer negative NDEs describe a terrifying abyss of darkness, isolation, and regret—both aligning with biblical descriptions.</li>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
