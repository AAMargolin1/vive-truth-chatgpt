          VIVE Truth is a project dedicated to the rigorous, analytical exploration of the evidence for Christianity. We believe that faith is not a blind leap, but a reasoned trust in a God
          who has revealed Himself through creation, history, and the person of Jesus Christ. Our mission is to present this evidence clearly and compellingly for a skeptical world.
